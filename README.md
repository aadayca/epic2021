# epic2021
This repository contains all project files for work completed for the EPIC initiative in summer 2021.

This is a line from RStudio.

Now I know how to sync my work from RStudio to GitHub. Simply:

1. Make some changes to a file (like README) in RStudio.
2. Save the changes locally.
3. Access the "Git" tab to the right.
4. Check the "Staged" box for any files that were modified.
5. Click "Diff" to see any differences.
6. Click "commit".
7. "Pull" from GitHub in case anyone made any changes to main.
8. Click "Push" to push the modifications back to GitHub.

*ta-da!*
